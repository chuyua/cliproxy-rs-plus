# Live prompt-cache check for the cloaked Claude path. Run by hand against a running
# cliproxy-rs whose Claude login is an OAuth subscription; it is not part of CI and it
# spends real tokens (about 75k input tokens on Opus, most of them cache reads).

#
# It streams one conversation through /v1/messages the way a coding client does (a
# caller system prompt, tools, a long first user message, a tool call as the first
# reply) and prints Anthropic's own usage for each turn: uncached input, cache reads,
# and cache writes split into the 5-minute and 1-hour pools.
#
# The first reply is a tool call on purpose. An OAuth login moves the caller prompt to
# a system turn just before the first assistant turn. In probes on claude-opus-5-5 on
# 14 October 2026, the next turn did not reuse the cold turn's cache entry for that
# system turn when the assistant turn after it held only text, either made up or the
# model's own reply with its thinking block removed: it read up to the first user
# message and wrote the caller prompt again. A tool call, or the model's reply replayed
# with its thinking block, reused it. The messages sent upstream were byte-identical
# through the system turn in both cases, and so were the tools and the identity block;
# only the billing header differed, as it does on every turn. That points to
# Anthropic's cache handling, not to the proxy.
#
#   cold     the first turn: writes the prefix.
#   warm     the next turn at once: reads everything the cold turn wrote, writes its tail.
#   changed  the warm turn with an edited caller system prompt: reads up to the first
#            user message, writes the rest (an OAuth login moves the caller prompt
#            after it).
#   idle     the turn after warm, IDLE_SECONDS later (default 330, past the 5-minute
#            TTL): still reads everything warm cached, because an OAuth login's
#            breakpoints are written to the 1-hour pool.
#
# Expectations are checked and the script exits 1 when one fails or the usage does not
# show them. With several Claude logins, keep the conversation on one of them (session
# affinity); the cache belongs to the account, so a turn routed to another login reads
# nothing. The key reaches curl on stdin, never on its command line, and is not printed;
# curl ignores ~/.curlrc.
#
# Environment: CPA_URL (default http://127.0.0.1:8317), CPA_KEY (required), MODEL
# (default claude-opus-5-5; a current model, since older ones put the caller prompt
# before the document), IDLE_SECONDS (default 330, between 301 and 3300), DOC_LINES
# (default 600, at least 300; about 30 tokens a line).
