//! A downstream WebSocket turn on a Home credential hands its pick to the executor as
//! a [`Pick`]. When the executor keeps the upstream socket for later turns it retains
//! the pick, and after the turn succeeds the pick takes the lease over from the
//! attempt: the credential stays leased while the socket is open. The pick ends, and
//! the lease is released, when the socket is invalidated, replaced or closed, when
//! Home drains it (the socket closes first), or when the downstream connection ends.
//! The next turn of the same session runs on a still-active pick instead of asking
//! Home again.
